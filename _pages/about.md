# About Planetoids

**Planetoids** is a modern retro-style space shooter built in Python using Pygame. Inspired by arcade classics like *Asteroids*, *Defender*, and *Galaga*, it reimagines that era with momentum-based controls, glitchy CRT aesthetics, and a focus on visual polish.

This project is a personal tribute to the golden age of arcades — and a chance to explore the intersection of code, nostalgia, and design.

### Core Features

- **Momentum-based controls**: Thrust, drift, and rotate through space like a true arcade pilot.
- **Screen wraparound**: Classic mechanic that keeps you in motion — and always on edge.
- **Dynamic power-ups**: Trishot, Quadshot, Ricochet, Time Slow, Invincibility, and more.
- **Score multiplier system**: Build up a streak-based multiplier that decays over time.
- **Visual FX**: CRT shaders, flicker, scanlines, glitch effects, bullet trails, and debris.

### Technical Highlights

Planetoids was built with care using:
- Python 3.11
- Pygame
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD, PyPI deploys, release packaging)
- Sphinx + Jekyll (for docs and devlog)

It’s fully installable via:

```bash
pip3 install planetoids-game
```

### Why Build It?

I wanted a project that could:
- Push my technical + visual design skills
- Be finished and polished end-to-end
- Blend creative expression with structured engineering
- Give nostalgic players something new to enjoy

Planetoids is more than a game — it’s a love letter and an evolving experiment in indie dev polish.
